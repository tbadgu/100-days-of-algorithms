Problem demonstrates 2 principles of DP:

Matrix Chain Multiplication for ABCD 
= Min({A,BCD}, {AB,CD}, {ABC,D})
= Min({A, Min({B,CD}, {BC,D})}, {AB,CD}, {Min({A,BC}, {AB,C}),D})


1) Optimal Substructure
You'll find we are breaking down the problem into similar sub problems.

2) Overlapping subproblems
You'll find that we are solving same problem more that once such as AB, BC.
Memorization can help avoid solving the same problems again and again.
